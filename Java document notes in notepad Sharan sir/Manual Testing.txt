Kotlin

Web Automation tools:
---------------------
To test the websites tools are 
1.selenium
2.zelenium
3.wdio

API AUTOMATION TOOLS:
--------------------
1.Restassure supported by java only
2.Rest supported by Python

What is Testing:
Testing means we have to do project verification and project validation.
Testing---Testing means project must be verified and then must be validated.Now, we have to check whether product bug free or bugs.


Verification
************
It means checking the document,designs,plans,scripts etc...
Tester should verify developer product is strictly implemented or not.
It is static testing.
It doesn't require coding to execute.
The goal of verification is the developed product must reach required architecture and specifications.
Verification is nothing but  prevention of errors.

Validations(Conditions must be applied)
***********
It checks by validating the actual product using conditions.
Tester should validate developed product strictly implementing scripts using conditions.
It is dynamic testing.
It requires coding knowledge to execute.
The goal of validation is the developed product should satisfy with all the given conditions.
It is detection of errors.

Verification Real Time Example:
******************************


Example 1:Assume that a team is developing e-commerce website(Safeway.com)
1.During verification the first thing is review the requirements and design documents:

a) Requirements means features like:search option,auto suggestions,displaying list of products(images,quantity,
price, cart option,payment option,address filling option,login option)

Example 2:Assume that a team is developing mobile application(HDFC App)
1.During verification the first thing is review the requirements and design documents:

a) Requirements means features like(login,balance check,FD options,Fund Transfering,Loan details,Card Details,
Fund transfer history details,logout etc...)

Conclusion
**********
Here,it means that peer to peer review ,inspections must be done.
It should include correctly detailed design.

Validation Real time examples
*****************************

Example 1:Team developed the e-commerce website(safeway)

a)Tester has to do testing like :
  login is successful or not
  Search option is able to search all the items
  Auto suggestion option is working or not
  Able to see the details in cart
  Payment option is working or not

Example 2:
b)Team developed mobile banking application
  tester has to do following like:
  Login is  successful or not
  Able to see balance amount
  Able to see fixed deposit option
  Fund transfer is successfulor not
  Fund transfer history

 Conclusion
 *********
 Please ensure that developed app works as expected and meets user requirements

 Verification---->Development---->Validation
 Validation can be done manually and by automation.


 Steps in manual testing
 ***********************
 1. Requirement Analysis-->Study about developing project documentation,designs,guidelines
 2. Test Plan creation -->Creating the test plan that covers all the requirements(features)
 3. Test case creation -->Create positive and negative test cases for every requirements.
 4. Test case execution-->If it is manually,we will write test cases on excel sheet,if it is automation,will create scripts
 5. Defect log -->once test case get executed,if any bugs takes place ,report to developers
 6. Defect fix and retesting-->Once developer fix the bug,again retest it to make it bug free

Types of Manual Testing
***********************
1.White Box Testing
2.Black Box Testing
3.Grey Box Testing

24-1-2025:
Black Box Testing
*****************
1)Here,entire project or particular methods or particular modules must be considered.
2)We have to test only the functionality(behavior of application) of the above.
3)Tester should provide input with both positive and negative test cases and check expected output is working fine
 as expected.
4)If input given by the tester,if it satisfies test case then status is passed.
5)If input given by the tester,if not satisfied,then  test case status is failed,if it is failing,tester should report the issue to development team.

Conclusion-It will be done by testers only to check the functionality of application.

Example
*******
Consider FB login
Requirements:username,password and sign in button

I have to enter wrong or correct username and password and checks positive and negative test cases are working as expected or not.
check sign in button is clickable or not.


White Box Testing
*****************
1)Here,internal structure i.e., coding part,designing part are considered.
2)Development team will review the code line by line(correctness of code).
3)Assume that if any code is missing then developer should correct the code as per the design.

Conclusion-It will be done by developers only for correctness of code.

Example-
Consider FB login
Requirements:username,password and sign in button

Designing and coding should be done properly for username,its text field.Password, its text field.Button with sign in text.


Grey Box Testing
****************
Its a combination of white box and black box testing.
It should be done by testers only.

Tester with coding knowledge can do white box testing also.

STLC(Software Testing Life cycle)
*********************************
STLC is a protocol to test the product so that product meets the requirements and it is free of defects.

1.Requirements Analysis

2.Test Planning

3.Test Case Development

4.Test Enviornment Setup

5.Test Execution

6.Test Closure

Requirement Analysis
********************
Here,testers will understand the requirements like what is to be tested.That is should get detail knowledge of the requirements.
we should get BRD(Business Requirement Document)

27/01/2024:

Test Enviornmet
***************
In test enviornment ,testers are not participated ,only the developers or customers creates the test enviornment.
It is an independent activity.

Test Execution
**************
Test Closure
************
Its a final stage of STLC.
we have to prepare the document in such a way that all tested features are working fine as expected.
Mention all the feature that you have tested you are must definitely give sign off.
Once sign off is done,lead can give the approval.


Severity in Testing
*******************
It can be understood as partciular defect can create an impact on the product.
Impact is of 4 types
1.Critical impact --> Here,severity level is completely out of box.No further action can be taken
2.Major impact --> Here,severity level is in such a way that product is failed but some are remains functioning.
3.Medium impact -->Here,severity level is unfavourable functionality,product is still functioning.
4.Low impact --> Here, severity level is won't cause major damage to the product.



Priority in testing
*******************
Priority means the order in which defect(severity) should be fixed.

Defects having high priority should be fixed first.

Types of Priority
*****************
1.Low
2.Medium 
3.High

High-->The defect must be resolved as soon as possible.
Medium--> The defect should be resolved during normal level.
Low-->The defect is irriant,it should be fixed only when serious defects are fixed.


Combinations of severity and priority
***************************************

High Severity-High priority
Examples:
1.Whenever you are filling web application all your personal details but not able to click the submit button.
2.Whenwever you are working on web application(downloading,uploading,selecting option),application should not be slow down.
3.When there is hover actions ,mouse is not working,it also leads to time consuming process.

High Severity-Low Priority
Examples:
1.Assume that you are working with older versions.
2.User is able to click on send OTP button but not able to receive OTP on time.

Low severity low priority
Examples:
1.In a website,think that Help option or frequently asked questions module not working properly with small text,font styles.
2.Assume that need to enter captcha with too much of different combinations.

Low Severity-High Priority
Examples:
1.Mis-spelled word, admission detials misspelled as admision.

Defect life cycle:
*****************
Defect status or bug status is the current state from which the defect is currently going through.
Steps are:
1.New
2.Assigned
3.Open
4.Fixed
5.Pending retest
6.Retest
7.Verified
8.Closed

1.New:
******
When any new defect is identified by the tester.It falls under new state.
Now tester want to prepare defect document(screenshots,error reports etc).
This defect document must assigned to developer team.
2.Assigned:
**********
Here,new state will get approved by team lead and assigned to developer team to resolve that issue.
Here,developer team need to change the status to assigned state.
3.Open:
*******
In this open state the defect is being addressed by the developer team .
Once discussion is done by developer team they have to fix the bug.
In discussion if it is not bug they have to reject.
4.Fixed:
*******
After necessary changes of code developer team mark the state as fixed.
5.Pending Request:
*****************
During the fixing after defect is completed, the developer team sent the new code to testing team for retesting.
Now its state changes to pending request
6.Retest:
********
At this stage,tester starts working of retesting the defect.
To check weather defect is fixed by developer or not and mark the status as retesting.
7.Verified:
**********
The tester retest the bug after it got fixed by the developer team.
If the tester does't find any kind of defect then we can say that bug is fixed and the status changed to verified.
8.Closed:
********
After fixing the bug by developer team and testing is done, means that issue got resolved then the defect must be closed.
